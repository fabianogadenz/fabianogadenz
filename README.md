# Hi guys ðŸ‘‹

My name is Fabiano, I'm from Brazil and I'm a mobile engineer, always looking to learn and build nice applications. I'm graduated in Computer Science and currently working as a senior mobile engineer at [Remessa Online](https://www.remessaonline.com.br/) and sometimes tech lead in [PlugApps](https://www.plugapps.net/).

I'm focused in mobile applications for the past five years, specifically in Flutter since 2018. I'm always eager to grow my knowledge in the fundamentals of computer science like algorithm, software architecture, data structures, product data analytics and technical leadership.

I work well in a team and navigate well in product discussions. I'm always curious to learn whatever is needed to build a great digital product for customers, always drawing on my experience in the mobile world.

Until today, I have won 3 professional awards.
- Professional Dedication of the year 2013 award at Cybersul;
- Top 3 Brazil at Nasa Space Apps Hackathon - 2019;
- Highlight Professional Q4 - 2021 Revolution Maker on Remessa Online.
