# Hi guys ðŸ‘‹

My name is Fabiano, I am from Brazil and I'm a mobile engineer, always looking to learn and build cool stuff. I'm graduated in Computer Science and currently working as a sÃªnior mobile engineer at [Remessa Online](https://www.remessaonline.com.br/) and sometimes tech lead in [PlugApps](https://www.plugapps.net/).

I am focused on mobile applications have 5 years, in expecifical Flutter since 2018. I'm always looking to improve my knowledge on the fundamentals of computer science like algorithm, data structures, product data analytics and technical leadership.

I can work well in a team and navigate well in product discussions. I'm always curious to learn whatever is needed to build a great digital product for customers, always reusing my experience in the mobile world.
